Appointing-Workers
==================
In the past, we've already tackled the challenge of deciding in which order to do certain jobs. However, now you need to work out which worker gets which job. What if some workers are only qualified to do certain jobs? How do you ensure there are no jobs or workers left out? Your challenge now is (given some jobs that need to be done, and some workers and the jobs they're allowed to do) compute who should be given which job, so no-one is doing a job they are not qualified for.
Input Description:
On the console, you will be given numbers N. N represents the number of jobs that need to be done, and the number of workers. See sample inputs in project folder.
You will then be given a list of N jobs (on separate lines), followed by N workers and the jobs they're allowed to do (separated by commas, one worker per line).
Note that there may be more than one possible assignment of workers.
Output Description:
You must print the list of workers, along with the job each worker is assigned to.
